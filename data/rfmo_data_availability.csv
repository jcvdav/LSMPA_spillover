RFMO,Gear,Max temporal resolution,Max spatial resolution,Flag,Used,Notes
WCPFC,PS,month,5°,No,,Worst resolution and no flag
WCPFC,PS,quarter,5°,Yes,,Too low spatial resolution
WCPFC,PS,annual,5°,Yes,,Too low spatial resolution
WCPFC,PS,month,1°,No,,"We would lose flag, which is reported in all other data sets"
WCPFC,PS,quarter,1°,Yes,X,Highest spatio-temporal resolution that still retains flag
WCPFC,LL,month,5°,No,,Worst resolution and no flag
WCPFC,LL,quarter,5°,Yes,X,I am 50/50 on using this one: 1) Matches temporal resolution of PS data from WCPFC and 2) Good balance between monthly (we lose lots of data due to privacy) and annual (would be the only annual-level data set)
WCPFC,LL,annual,5°,Yes,,"Alternatively, we use this one because we get as much data as possible (there is less data loss due to privacy concerns), we don't lose any spatial resolution, and we don't lose any flag info. However, it would be the only raw annual data set."
WCPFC,LL,month,5°,Yes,,"I think this gets us a false sense of precission. Yes, we might have 8 times more observations, but we are actualy loosing about 20% of the catch and effort data relative to annual."
IATTC,PS,month,1°,Yes,X,Only one available
IATTC,LL,month,5°,Yes,X,Only one available
IOTC,PS,month,1°,Yes,X,"Data are aggregated ""preferably to monthly"", but might not be reported as such. PS effort data is mostly reported in fishing days, even though the say sets is a better measure."
IOTC,LL,month,5°,Yes,X,
ICCAT,PS,month,1°,Yes,X,"There is just one data set. Sometimes month is not reported, but they will report the year or the quarter. The spatial resolution also varies, although it follows the patterns we've observed for PS and LL (1 and 5, respectively)."
ICCAT,LL,month,5°,Yes,X,In the same file as PS
